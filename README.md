# Monokai-HighContrast
A high contrast theme for Visual Studio Code based on the TextMate Monokai theme.

This theme already diverges on a number of colors, but ultimately the general pallet will still look similar to the original.

# What's New?
	- Everything. Everything is new. Including me.
	- The theme is loosely organized. It's mostly cobbled together ad hoc from my tinkering with what worked and what didn't.

# To Do
	- Organize sections by language for greater clarity
	- Add to Visual Studio Code site (it does work though if added manually)
	- File icons?
	- Extension icon

# Tested Languages
	- C++
	- XML
