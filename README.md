# Monokai - High Contrast
A high contrast theme for Visual Studio Code based on the TextMate Monokai theme.

This theme already diverges on a number of colors, but ultimately the general pallet will still look similar to the original. Conceptually, the goal is to hew to the pastel aesthetic while maximizing 
contrast between functionally distinct elements.
