# Monokai - High Contrast
A high contrast theme for Visual Studio Code based on the TextMate Monokai theme.

This theme already diverges on a number of colors, but ultimately the general pallet will still look similar to the original.

# What's New?
- Everything. Everything is new. Should this even be here?
- The theme is loosely organized. It's mostly cobbled together ad hoc from my tinkering with what worked and what didn't.

# Tested Languages
- C++
- XML
- JSON

# To Do
- Test many more languages
- Organize sections by language for greater clarity
- Better extension icon
- Make everything nice on the Marketplace
- File icons?
- ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Learn those other languages
- Discover that an editor theme is the only path to the one true Morty
